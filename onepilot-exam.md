###3 package I would suggest

- Swagger for API documentation and resource/collection returns
- Toastr for better notification and error handling
- PhpStan for php verification code

###How to improve this project from a code perspective
- I would totally seperate front from back, use lumen instead of laravel as we're using only js and json.

###How to improve from a product perspective
- More reactive components, easier organization creation and edition.
- Make a printable reports as be able to download them in PDF
- Export datas into CSV files.
